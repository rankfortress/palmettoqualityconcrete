	Concrete is an often preferred choice for residential and commercial landscaping due to its low cost, versatility and durability. It is the perfect choice for patios that are a little uneven because it can be poured so thick around one side of the patio’s perimeter. It is also an excellent choice for people who don’t want to spend money on expensive pavers or mulch because it can be used as both.
